**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `conversation` | The conversation that this response belongs to. Input items and output items from this response are automatically added to this conversation. |
| `createdAt` | Unix timestamp (in seconds) of when this Response was created. |
| `error` | An error object returned when the model fails to generate a Response. |
| `id` | Unique identifier for this Response. |
| `incompleteDetails` | Details about why the response is incomplete. |
| `instructions` | A system (or developer) message inserted into the model's context.   When using along with previous_response_id, the instructions from a previous response     will not be carried over to the next response. This makes it simple to swap out system (or     developer) messages in new responses. |
| `maxOutputTokens` | An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a response, including visible output tokens and reasoning tokens. |
| `maxToolCalls` | The maximum number of total calls to built-in tools that can be processed in a response. This maximum number applies across all built-in tool calls, not per     individual tool. Any further attempts to call a tool by the model will be ignored. |
| `metadata` | Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying     for objects via API or the dashboard.       Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a     maximum length of 512 characters. |
| `model` | Model ID used to generate the response, like gpt-4o or o3. OpenAI offers a wide range of models with different capabilities, performance characteristics, and price points.     Refer to the model guide to browse and compare available models. |
| `object` | The object type of this resource - always set to `ResponseObject`. |
| `output` | An array of content items generated by the model.   The length and order of items in the output array is dependent on the model's response.     Rather than accessing the first item in the output array and assuming it's an assistant     message with the content generated by the model, you might consider using the output_text     property where supported in SDKs. |
| `parallelToolCalls` | Whether to allow the model to run tool calls in parallel. |
| `prompt` | Reference to a prompt template and its variables. Learn more. |
| `promptCacheKey` | Used by OpenAI to cache responses for similar requests to optimize your cache hit rates. Replaces the user field. Learn more. |
| `promptCacheRetention` | The retention policy for the prompt cache. Set to 24h to enable extended prompt caching, which keeps cached prefixes active for longer, up to a maximum of     24 hours. Learn more. |
| `reasoning` | gpt-5 and o-series models only   Configuration options for reasoning models. |
| `safetyIdentifier` | A stable identifier used to help detect users of your application that may be violating OpenAI's usage policies. The IDs should be a string that uniquely     identifies each user. We recommend hashing their username or email address, in order to     avoid sending us any identifying information. Learn more. |
| `serviceTier` | Specifies the processing type used for serving the request.   If set to 'auto', then the request will be processed with the service tier configured in     the Project settings. Unless otherwise configured, the Project will use 'default'. If set     to 'default', then the request will be processed with the standard pricing and performance     for the selected model. If set to 'flex' or 'priority', then the request will be processed     with the corresponding service tier. When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'. When the     service_tier parameter is set, the response body will include the service_tier value based     on the processing mode actually used to serve the request. This response value may be     different from the value set in the parameter. |
| `status` | The status of the response generation. One of `completed`, `failed`, `in_progress`, `cancelled`, `queued`, or `incomplete`. |
| `temperature` | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and     deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both. |
| `text` | Configuration options for a text response from the model. Can be plain text or structured JSON data. Learn more:             - Text inputs and outputs - Structured           Outputs |
| `toolChoice` | How the model should select which tool (or tools) to use when generating a response. See the `tools` parameter to see how to specify which tools the model can     call. |
| `tools` | An array of tools the model may call while generating a response. You can specify which tool to use by setting the tool_choice parameter.       We support the following categories of tools:       Built-in tools: Tools that are provided by OpenAI that extend the model's capabilities,     like web     search or file     search. Learn more about built-in tools. MCP Tools:     Integrations with third-party systems via custom MCP servers or predefined connectors such     as Google Drive and SharePoint. Learn more about MCP Tools. Function     calls (custom tools): Functions that are defined by you, enabling the model to call your     own code with strongly typed arguments and outputs. Learn more about function calling. You     can also use custom tools to call your own code. |
| `topLogprobs` | An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. |
| `topP` | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only     the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.       We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both. |
| `truncation` | The truncation strategy to use for the model response.               - `auto`: If the input to this Response exceeds the model's context window size,           the model will truncate the response to fit the context window by dropping items from           the beginning of the conversation. - `disabled` (default): If the input size will exceed the context window size for           a model, the request will fail with a 400 error. |
